requirement gathering and analysis(analyze user stories and raised queris if any)

test plan and test strategy(high level info will be there like scope of proj resouce ETA test plan has low level document)
scope(in scope fucntionalities to be tested and out of scope)
approach(agile,watermodel)
env(whic env to use)
role and responsibilities(people involved in testing,BA,test)
entry/exit criteria
execution schedule(ETA or timeline)
risk((during time crunch we can tell the risk(eg.4 test env) or low priority TC )
issues(open issues)
dependacies(which components for the testing like ods sync)

env setup(link to URL,applications)

test design(Test cases)

defect reporting and closure(test summary report like net)

DFLC
new->open-> assigned->investigation->ready for retest->retest in progress->
passed->done
new after logging new defect
after review from leads move to open
assigned to dev
ready for retest(picked by QA changed by dev)
retest in progress(QA workin status)
done(resolved)

if defect out of scope or complex defect post discussion with BA moved to deferred to next sprint
if invalid defect then rejected



Test methodologies
waterfall
agile
agile cermonies
sprint planinng(PO,dev,test,BA,all stackholders)
daily scrum(issue/concerns,updates,blockers etc)
sprint review(stakholder,BA,update the stackholder about the test activity progress)
retrospective(after completing of sprint what went well what could do improved)




test data,steps,accounts used,env,exp ,actual,timestap evidence,priority,severity

test scenario:
id,desc,tc id, tc desc
tc doc- ts id, tc id,desc, step, expect


login func
user valid valid  invalid invalid blank blank   blank 
pws  valid invalid valid invalid  valid invalid blank

file compressor
verify if file size is reduced
verify if all file formats are accepted
verify if error is shown if no file is uploaded
verify if contents in file is same or corrupted
verify if file is downloaded
verify if file is able to open
verify if file is same as requested format
verfiy if file diff format as requested
verify if converted file is able to be uploaded
verify if converted file can be reduced



search fucntionlity in a field

look for accpetance criterio
after retest execute blocked
